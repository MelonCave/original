The other posts and content might be relevant or useful for some time, but on December 18th, 2025, I am moving on to the mdBook version of the MelonCave Personal Knowledge Mgmt system as a basis for the MelonCave podcast.

MelonCave is about ***caving in the melon*** of that personal demon who wants us to to quit ... it's really about overcoming the bad habits and addictions of being ourselves. The solution is going to be about the AA/Celebrate Recovery process, to humble ourselves, acknowledging a higher power, using every weapon in our arsenal to ***caving in the melon*** of that personal demon who wants us to to give up and just go along with the easy, quickie bandaid fixes. This is not easy of course, because it's personal and involves attacking our love of those personal habits, addictions, behaviors that that are stopping us from taking greater responsibility for developing better open source ways *to program ourselves ... so that we may BETTER train ourselves.*

## The ORIGINAL MelonCave content was about autodidactic training and going forward we delve deeper into cognitive fitness and overcoming the bad habits of being ourselves.

We certainly have not abandoned autodidactic training ... in fact, that that the basis of our examination of cognitive fitness and taking better advantage of our knowledge/research into of topics like neuroplasticity.

1) Do your own introductory noodling around ... use Wikipedia, Pubmed, ConnectedPapers ... but READ ... avoid YouTube channels and podcasts like the PLAGUE ... READ, READ, READ. Wire your brain for READING ... while you DO the hands-on reps.

2) On the basis of your background preparation, formulate a reasonably coherent prompt for an AI Assistant like [Claude, Opus 3](https://claude.ai/chat/) or better ... your prompt might look something like the following; don't worry about getting it perfect OR about being too wordy ... you will reform the prompt to address its weakness later -- at first, just get started with an outline.

    "Develop a 200 module graduate-level or post-graduate-level syllabus for cognitive strategies and neuroexercise workouts for dealing with pain rather than running from it; the general gist of the syllabus should be based on techniques similar to Meditation Based Stress Mgmt but it might be a good idea to incorporate Christian prayer and other effective pain management strategies that do not involve reaching for drugs, alcohol or prescription medications as the first strategic option."

3) Work through the 200-module syllabus ... do your own introductory noodling around using the syllabus as a roadmap ... use Wikipedia, Pubmed, ConnectedPapers ... but READ ... avoid YouTube channels and podcasts like the PLAGUE ... READ, READ, READ. Wire your brain for READING ... while you DO the hands-on reps.

4) REPEAT steps 2 and 3 over and over, while ALSO moving on to step 5... but take time each day to put what you are learning into direct practices in your own DAILY training regimen, which [at a minimum] should include: body weight calistenics, planks, walking, martial arts drills, weighted yoga, gardening/landscaping/housekeeping ... the level of intensity in your training should be such that for at least 1/2 hour/day or 3 hrs per day, you are sufficiently eustressed by the exertion such that it's slightly uncomfortable to carry on a converstation.

5) Use EVERY incidence of any time to PAIN to *lean in* to the pain.
